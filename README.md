Typing-Head-To-Head is a web app that allows players to compete against each other in one versus one typing races

Players are first prompted to enter a username before choosing to participate in a public game, a solo game, or a private game.

Once a player has chosen a mode and has been matched into a game they are shown a passage of text. The first player to correctly type each word in the passage is declared the winner.

Players are also able to type messages to each other in a public chat room, or in a private game room.
